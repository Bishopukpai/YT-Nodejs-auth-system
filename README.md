# Backend User Authentication Application

Welcome !, This Node.js application provides a robust backend solution for user authentication, and email verification built with Express and MongoDB. If you're developing a web application, this backend offers secure user authentication features to ensure your users' data remains protected.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allow users to sign up for an account with a unique username and password.
- **User Login**: Enable users to securely log in to their accounts using their credentials.
- **Password Encryption**: Implement secure password encryption to protect user data.
- **Rate Limiting**: Reduces the number of times a particular user can attempt to log in.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and npm (Node Package Manager) Installed
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) atlas account

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bishopukpai/YT-Nodejs-auth-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd YT-Nodejs-auth-system
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   ```bash
      MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
   ```

Replace `"your-mongodb-uri"` with your MongoDB connection URI.


5. Start the server:

   ```bash
      npm start
    ```

## Usage
